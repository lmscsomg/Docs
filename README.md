This is a repository which stores some notes and cheatsheets.

##Have your own documentation
You can visit [here](http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) if you have
managing your documentation.

##Issues you may meet
If your documentation works well locally but fails when push it to the website, you may
meet the same problem just like me, you can visit here.
